# Poke Battle Project

This project consists of two separate parts: a **client** and a **server**. The client is a React application built with Vite, while the server is a Nest.js application. The two projects are structured as follows:

- **Client**: Located in the `/client` directory. This is the frontend application that interacts with the server.
- **Server**: Located in the `/poke-battle-server` directory. This is the backend API that handles Pokémon data and battle logic.
